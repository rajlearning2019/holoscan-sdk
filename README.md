## Getting Started

Visit the Holoscan User Guide to get started with the Holoscan SDK: <https://docs.nvidia.com/holoscan/sdk-user-guide/getting_started.html>

The Holoscan User Guide includes:
- An introduction to the NVIDIA Holoscan platform, including the Holoscan C++/Python SDK;
- Requirements and setup steps;
- Detailed SDK documentation, including a developer introduction, examples, and API details.

We also recommend visiting [NVIDIA HoloHub](https://github.com/nvidia-holoscan/holohub) to view
community projects and reusable components available for your Holoscan project.

## Obtaining the Holoscan SDK

The Holoscan User Guide documents several options to install and run the Holoscan SDK:

- As an [NGC Container üêã](https://docs.nvidia.com/holoscan/sdk-user-guide/sdk_installation.html#sd-tab-item-2)
- As a [Debian Package üì¶Ô∏è](https://docs.nvidia.com/holoscan/sdk-user-guide/sdk_installation.html#sd-tab-item-3)
- As a [Python Wheel üêç](https://docs.nvidia.com/holoscan/sdk-user-guide/sdk_installation.html#sd-tab-item-4)

Visit the [Holoscan User Guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/holoscan/sdk-user-guide/sdk_installation.html#not-sure-what-to-choose) for
guidance to help choose which installation option may be right for your use case.

If the options above do not support your use case, you may prefer to [build the SDK from source](./DEVELOP.md).

Please review [Holoscan SDK prerequisites](https://docs.nvidia.com/holoscan/sdk-user-guide/sdk_installation.html#prerequisites)
before getting started.

## Troubleshooting and Feedback

We appreciate community discussion and feedback in support of Holoscan platform users and developers. We ask that users:
- Review the [Holoscan SDK Frequently Asked Questions](FAQ.md) document for common solutions and workarounds.
- Direct questions to the [NVIDIA Support Forum](https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/c/healthcare/holoscan-sdk/320/all).
- Enter SDK issues on the [SDK GitHub Issues board](https://github.com/nvidia-holoscan/holoscan-sdk/issues).

## Contributing to Holoscan SDK

Holoscan SDK is developed internally and released as open source software. We welcome community contributions
and may include them in Holoscan SDK releases at our discretion. Please refer to the Holoscan SDK
[Contributing Guide](/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.

## Additional Notes

### Relation to NVIDIA Clara

In previous releases, the prefix [`Clara`](https://developer.nvidia.com/industries/healthcare) was used to define Holoscan as a platform designed initially for [medical devices](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/clara/developer-kits/). Starting with version 0.4.0, the Holoscan SDK is built to be domain-agnostic and can be used to build sensor AI applications in multiple domains. Domain specific content will be hosted on the [HoloHub](https://github.com/nvidia-holoscan/holohub) repository.

### Repository structure

The repository is organized as such:

- `cmake/`: CMake configuration files
- `data/`: directory where data will be downloaded
- `examples/`: source code for the examples
